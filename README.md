# StackSet-Implementation
StackSet Implementation using Linked Cells in Java

Defined behavior is a sort of stack, but with a uniqueness criterion on its elements, like a set contains unique elements. The code implements a Set(ignoring order) and behaves like a Stack(LIFO order). 

No code from Java Collections Library is used. Singly linked list implementation.
